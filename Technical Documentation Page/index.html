            <p><code>Introduction</code> to JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.</p>
            <p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
            <p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p></li>

                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><code>JavaScript and Java</code> are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
            <p>JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.</p>
            <p>JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.</p>
            <p>The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. </p>
            <p>JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.</p>
            <p> Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. </p>

            <p><code>Functions</code> guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Variables">Variables</header>

            <p>You use <code>Variables</code> as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). </p>
            <p>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. </p>
            <p>You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers</p>
            <p>Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <header id="Data types">Data types</header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven <code>Data Types</code>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    </ul>
